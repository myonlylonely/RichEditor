# RichEditor

RichEditor is a lightweight, accessible Win32 text editor built around the RichEdit control. It focuses on fast plain-text editing, strong accessibility, and an extensible filter system for power users.

## Highlights

- Plain-text editor with UTF-8 files (no BOM)
- Accessibility-first UI (screen reader friendly menus, accurate status bar data)
- Fast Find/Replace with history and undo support
- External filter system (transform, display, clipboard, and side-effect actions)
- URL auto-detection with keyboard activation
- Autosave (timer + app switch)
- Optional session resume for unsaved work
- Elevated save: retries with administrator permissions on access denied
- English + Czech resources in one binary

## Quick Start

Run the editor:

```cmd
RichEditor.exe
```

Open a file in read-only mode:

```cmd
RichEditor.exe /readonly "C:\path\file.txt"
```

Open without adding to MRU:

```cmd
RichEditor.exe /nomru "C:\path\file.txt"
```

Open a folder (shows the Open dialog preset to that folder):

```cmd
RichEditor.exe "C:\Projects\MyApp"
```

## Features (User-Facing)

### Editing

- New/Open/Save/Save As
- **Open Location** (Ctrl+L): type a file or folder path directly; the editor opens the file, presets the Open dialog to the folder, or offers to correct a path that does not exist
- **Open Resume File** (File menu): lists all session recovery files found in the recovery folder; opening one restores the `[Resumed]` state just as automatic startup recovery does; a **Delete all resume files** entry at the bottom clears the folder
- **Reload** (Ctrl+R): re-reads the current file from disk, discarding unsaved changes after confirmation; restores the caret's line and column even if the file's content shifted. For a recovered (`[Resumed]`) document, reloads the recovery snapshot itself rather than the original file, discarding only edits made since recovery
- Undo/Redo with descriptive labels
- Word wrap toggle
- Time/Date insertion (F5) with configurable templates
- Read-only mode with UI protection
- Elevated save: when saving to a protected path fails with access denied, the editor prompts to retry with administrator permissions (UAC)

### Find & Replace

- Find Next/Previous (F3 / Shift+F3)
- Replace and Replace All with undo support
- History (MRU) for find/replace terms
- Options (match case, whole word, escapes) persist on toggle

### Filters (Power Feature)

Filters run external commands and operate on selected text (or current line). Actions:

- **Insert**: replace / below / append
- **Display**: status bar / message box
- **Clipboard**: copy / append
- **None**: side-effect only

The `Command` field also accepts a `script:` prefix to run a JScript expression in-process without spawning an external process. The special variable `INPUT` holds the selected text (or current line). Example: `script:INPUT.toLocaleUpperCase()`. This avoids the code-page issues that affect PowerShell-based external filters with non-ASCII characters.

JScript reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions//hbxc2t98(v=vs.85)

Filters are configured in `RichEditor.ini` (auto-generated on first run).

### Accessibility

- Screen reader friendly menu labels
- Accurate status bar line/column (tab aware)
- URL detection announced as links

## Configuration

RichEditor auto-creates `RichEditor.ini` on first run. The INI lives next to the executable. The file is self-documenting and safe to edit.

Key settings include:

```ini
[Settings]
WordWrap=1
TabSize=8
AutosaveEnabled=1
AutosaveIntervalMinutes=1
AutosaveOnFocusLoss=1
SelectAfterPaste=0
ShowMenuDescriptions=1
AutoSaveUntitledOnClose=0
AutoSaveTempDir=
DetectURLs=1
```

### Find/Replace History

History is stored as:

```ini
[FindHistory]
Count=3
Item1=foo
Item2=bar
Item3=baz
```

`Item1` is always the most recent.

## Build

### MinGW-w64

## Localization

The binary ships with English and Czech resources. Windows selects the UI language automatically.
