# RichEditor User Manual (English)

RichEditor is a lightweight, accessible Win32 text editor for plain text. It is designed to stay fast, keep the interface predictable, and let power features live in external tools (filters and templates). The editor is DPI-aware (Per-Monitor V2) and renders sharply on high-DPI displays, including multi-monitor setups with mixed scaling. If you read this manual once, you will likely discover features that are intentionally hidden from the surface UI.

## Quick Start

Open and save like any classic editor: `File -> Open` (`Ctrl+O`) and `Ctrl+S`. Use `File -> Open Location` (`Ctrl+L`) to type a file or folder path directly — if you type a folder, the Open dialog appears preset to it; if the path does not exist, a warning appears and you can correct the path in the dialog. Use `File -> Reload` (`Ctrl+R`) to discard unsaved changes and re-read the current file from disk; the caret is restored to the same line and column whenever possible, even if the file changed underneath you. Toggle word wrap with `View -> Word Wrap` (`Ctrl+W`). Find, Replace, and Go to Line live under `Search` (`Ctrl+F`, `Ctrl+H`, `Ctrl+G`).

## UI Basics and Status Bar

### Title Bar Indicators

RichEditor is very explicit about state. The title bar uses:

- `*` for unsaved changes
- `[Read-Only]` when editing is blocked
- `[Resumed]` when a document was recovered after shutdown
- `[Interactive Mode]` while a REPL filter is running

### Status Bar

The status bar is built for accessibility and precision. It shows the cursor **position** (tab-aware), the **character** under the caret, and the **currently selected filter**.

When word wrap is ON, the position shows **visual** and **physical** values (soft-wrap vs. real line breaks). This is important for screen readers and for exact column work.

Advanced: the character field includes Unicode codes, control characters, surrogate pairs, and EOF. This makes the editor useful for inspecting files that contain invisible characters.

## Editing

Undo/Redo labels describe the last action (Typing, Paste, Replace All, etc.). Insert/Overtype mode toggles with the **Insert** key. `F5` inserts a time/date string based on your configuration.

Files are saved as UTF‑8 without BOM. Line endings are preserved when possible; default save uses Windows CRLF.

If saving fails because the target path requires administrator access, the editor prompts you to retry with elevated permissions. A UAC dialog will appear; if you approve, the file is saved using a temporary staging copy. This applies to both Save (`Ctrl+S`) and Save As.

Advanced: `SelectAfterPaste=1` selects pasted text automatically. Typing replaces the selection; this is a power feature, not a default.

## Word Wrap and Positions

Word wrap changes only how lines are **displayed**, not how they are saved.

- **Wrap ON**: lines wrap to the window width.
- **Wrap OFF**: long lines stay on one physical line.

Note: With Word Wrap off, RichEdit 8+ may still visually segment long lines around ~1000 characters without inserting line breaks. This matches Windows 11 Notepad behavior and is a display-only effect.

## Find and Replace

Find and Replace behave like classic editors (`Ctrl+F`, `Ctrl+H`, `F3`, `Shift+F3`). History is saved only when you perform Find/Replace/Replace All.

Go to Line (`Ctrl+G`) jumps to a specific line number and scrolls it into view.
Line counting follows Word Wrap mode: visual lines when wrap is ON, physical lines when wrap is OFF.

Advanced:
- Escape sequences: `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\\`, `\xNN`, `\uNNNN`. Any `\X` with an unrecognised `X` emits `X` (backslash dropped).
- Replace placeholders: `%0` inserts matched text, `%%` inserts a literal `%`
- Replace All can be fully undone.

## Autosave and Session Resume

Autosave runs on a timer (default: 1 minute) and when you switch to another application. Untitled files are not autosaved by default.

If Windows shuts down or restarts, RichEditor saves unsaved work to a recovery file and restores it on the next launch. Recovered files show `[Resumed]` in the title bar.

If the recovery file cannot be reached at startup (for example, if the editor is a portable app that was last used on a different machine), a warning is shown with the path and the recovery pointer is kept for the next launch. Once the location is accessible, use **File → Open Resume File** to open it manually.

**File → Open Resume File** lists all recovery files found in the recovery folder. Selecting one opens it with the same `[Resumed]` state as automatic recovery — `Ctrl+S` opens a Save As dialog since the original path is not known for files opened this way. The **Delete all resume files** entry at the bottom of the submenu permanently removes all files in the recovery folder.

Advanced: `AutoSaveUntitledOnClose=1` saves untitled work on close without prompting.

## Reload

`File -> Reload` (`Ctrl+R`) re-reads the current file from disk, discarding unsaved changes. If there are unsaved changes, a confirmation is shown first. The caret is restored to the same line and column afterward whenever possible, even if the file's content changed — RichEditor searches for the surrounding text near the old position (and, if needed, anywhere in the document) rather than relying on a raw character count that could now point somewhere else entirely. A brief `[Reloaded]` message flashes in the status bar when done.

Reload is unavailable only for a document that has never been saved and has no recovery snapshot to fall back on.

For a document recovered from a previous session (`[Resumed]` in the title), Reload behaves differently on purpose: it re-reads the *recovery snapshot itself*, not the original file at its saved location. This discards only the edits made since recovery, reverting to the state RichEditor recovered — it does not touch the original file and the document remains marked `[Resumed]` afterward. This always asks for confirmation, even if the document currently shows no unsaved changes, since autosave can save a resumed document's content to its original location while intentionally keeping the recovery state active — reloading in that state could otherwise silently revert to an older snapshot. To load the clean, pre-crash version of the original file instead, use `File -> Open` on that path directly.

## Read-Only Mode

Read-only mode prevents edits but still allows viewing and navigation. You can open files, use Save As, copy and select text, run Find, and use non-destructive filters.

## Filters (External Tools)

Filters run external commands on selected text (or the current line if nothing is selected). They can insert output, display it, copy it to the clipboard, or run for side effects only. This lets you build features without bloating the editor itself. Interactive (REPL, Read‑Eval‑Print Loop) filters exist for advanced use and are described in the INI section.

Examples include Uppercase/Lowercase, Sort Lines, Line Count, and Word Count. These are meant as starting points; the rest is for you to explore in the menus.

The built-in **Smart Continue** filter (`Ctrl+Enter` with that filter selected) appends a new line below the current one. It detects what kind of line you are on and continues accordingly: unordered bullets (`-`, `+`, `*`) repeat the same bullet; ordered numeric lists (`1.` / `1)`) increment the number; ordered letter lists (`a)` / `A)`) advance to the next letter (with carry: `z`→`aa`, `Z`→`AA`); any other line copies the leading indent only. If you have an existing `RichEditor.ini` with the old Auto Indent filter in `[Filter8]`, replace its `Command=`, `Name=`, and description lines with the new Smart Continue defaults.

Advanced: filters and categories are defined in `RichEditor.ini`. Categories are user-defined and can be renamed or replaced. You can also control whether a filter appears in the context menu.

The `Command` field accepts a `script:` prefix to run a JScript expression in-process (no external process spawned). The special variable `INPUT` holds the selected text. Example: `script:INPUT.toLocaleUpperCase()`. This correctly handles all Unicode characters including diacritics. JScript reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions//hbxc2t98(v=vs.85)

Three things to keep in mind when writing `script:` expressions:

- The value after `script:` must be a single expression — bare statements such as `var x = 1` are not valid at the top level; for multi-step logic, use an IIFE that returns its result: `(function(){var n=INPUT.length;return String(n)})()`.
- If the expression evaluates to `undefined`, `null`, or an empty string, the filter silently produces no output and no error — wrapping the result in `String(…)` is a safe habit.
- A semicolon preceded by a space or tab anywhere in `Command=` is treated as the start of an INI comment and silently drops everything after it, so keep semicolons tight against their preceding token: write `return x})()` not `return x })()`.

## Templates

Templates insert snippets with variables. You can insert them from `Tools -> Insert Template`, use the template picker (`Ctrl+Shift+T`), or create new documents from templates under `File -> New`.

### Template Variables

Templates support these variables:

- `%cursor%` — cursor position after insertion
- `%selection%` — current selection
- `%clipboard%` — clipboard text
- `%date%`, `%time%` — configurable formats
- `%shortdate%`, `%longdate%`, `%yearmonth%`, `%monthday%`
- `%shorttime%`, `%longtime%`

Advanced: templates are editable in `RichEditor.ini`. You can localize template names and descriptions using `Name.xx` and `Description.xx` keys (for example, `Name.cs`). Unknown variables are preserved as literals.

## Addons (Filter and Template Packs)

You can extend RichEditor by placing addon packs in an `addons` folder next to the executable. Each addon is a subdirectory containing `filters.ini`, `templates.ini`, and/or `autocorrections.ini`.

Example layout:

```
RichEditor.exe
addons/
  my-tools/
    filters.ini
    tools/
      myfilter.exe
  snippets/
    templates.ini
  my-corrections/
    autocorrections.ini
```

- Addon INI files use the same `[Filter1]`/`[Template1]` section format as the main `RichEditor.ini`. The `Count=` key is optional; if omitted, sections are probed sequentially.
- Addon directories are loaded alphabetically by name.
- If an addon defines a filter or template with the same `Name=` as an existing one, the addon version overwrites it (last loaded wins). The override is logged to the output pane.
- Filter commands from addons are executed with their addon directory as the working directory, so relative paths to bundled tools work.
- Use `Tools -> Reload Addons` to reload all addons without restarting.

## Autocorrection Tables

Autocorrection tables define search → replace pairs that can be applied while you type, to incoming REPL output, or manually via the menu.

**Manual use:** `Tools → Apply Autocorrections → _Table name_` applies the selected table to the current selection, or to the whole document if nothing is selected. The operation is undoable. The submenu is greyed out when no tables are loaded or when the editor is in read-only mode.

**Typing:** Tables marked `typing` in `[AutocorrectionSettings]` are checked after every keystroke. The characters immediately before the caret are tested against each entry (longest search string first); the first match is replaced in place as a single undoable action.

**Search key flags:** Prefix a search key with `~` for case-insensitive matching, `<` for whole-word matching, or both (e.g. `~<colour`). A leading `\~` or `\<` is treated as a literal character.

**Cursor placement (`\c`):** Place `\c` anywhere in a replace string to mark where the caret should land after the replacement. Everything before `\c` is inserted to the left of the cursor; everything after is inserted to the right. Example: `(=(\c)` types `(` and produces `()` with the cursor between the parentheses.

**Important — escape `[` and `<` at the start of a search key.** A line beginning with `[` is treated as an INI section header and silently terminates the table, causing all entries that follow it to be ignored. A leading `<` is consumed as the whole-word flag. Both must be escaped with a backslash: `\[=[\c]` and `\<=<h1>\c</h1>`. The `(` character does not need escaping, which can give a false sense of security before you add the `[` entry.

**Smart-pair helpers:** When a replace string contains `\c` and its closing part is a single character, two extra helpers activate automatically (controlled by `SmartPairAssist=1` in `[Settings]`, which is the default):
- Typing that closing character when the caret is already immediately before it skips over it instead of inserting a duplicate.
- Pressing Backspace immediately after the pair was inserted deletes both characters together.

Set `SmartPairAssist=0` to disable both helpers without affecting `\c` cursor placement itself.

**Sound feedback:** You can optionally play a WAV file whenever a typing autocorrection fires. Set `AutocorrectionSound=<path>` in `[Settings]` — relative paths resolve from the `RichEditor.exe` directory. Leave it empty (the default) for no sound.

**REPL output:** Tables marked `repl` are applied to each chunk of text received from the REPL process, before ANSI colour codes are stripped.

Tables are defined in `autocorrections.ini` files inside addon packs, or directly in `RichEditor.ini`. Activation is controlled by `[AutocorrectionSettings]` in the main `RichEditor.ini` (never in addon files). See `docs/autocorrection_tables.md` for the full INI reference.

## URL Handling

URLs are detected automatically. Press Enter on a URL to open it, or right-click to open/copy. If cursor movement feels slow on a very large file, set `DetectURLs=0` in `[Settings]` and restart.

## Configuration (INI)

On first run, RichEditor creates `RichEditor.ini` next to the executable. The file is self‑documenting with comments, and you can safely edit it while the app is closed. Lines starting with `;` or `#` are treated as comments. If you remove the comments and want them back, delete the INI file and let RichEditor recreate it.

Below is a complete, structured overview of all INI sections and keys currently used by the editor. Defaults shown here match the autogenerated INI.

### [Settings]

Editor behavior and defaults.

- `WordWrap` (default `1`): 1 = wrap enabled, 0 = disabled; controls whether long lines wrap to the window width.
- `AutosaveEnabled` (default `1`): master autosave switch.
- `AutosaveIntervalMinutes` (default `1`): autosave interval; 0 disables timer autosave even if enabled.
- `AutosaveOnFocusLoss` (default `1`): autosave when switching to another app.
- `ShowMenuDescriptions` (default `1`): show filter descriptions in menus (accessibility).
- `SelectAfterPaste` (default `0`): select pasted text automatically.
- `AutoSaveUntitledOnClose` (default `0`): save untitled work on close without prompting.
- `AutoSaveTempDir` (default empty): custom folder for recovery and elevated-save staging files. Leave empty to use `%TEMP%\RichEditor\`. Set to a raw absolute path (environment variables are not expanded). Useful when running RichEditor as a portable app — point this to a folder that travels with the exe so recovery files are always accessible.
- `DetectURLs` (default `1`): 1 = detect and highlight URLs (blue underline, click/Enter to open, screen reader announces as link). Set to 0 if cursor movement is slow on very large files — RichEdit scans the document on every keystroke when URL detection is on. Requires restart. Status bar shows "URL: off" when disabled.
- `TabSize` (default `8`): tab width in spaces for column calculation (valid range 1–32).
- `SelectAfterFind` (default `1`): keep found text selected after a successful find.
- `FindMatchCase` (default `0`): match case by default in Find/Replace.
- `FindWholeWord` (default `0`): whole‑word search by default.
- `FindUseEscapes` (default `0`): interpret escape sequences (\n, \t, \xNN, \uNNNN) in Find/Replace. Any unrecognised `\X` emits `X` (backslash dropped).

Date and time formatting.

- `DateTimeTemplate` (default `%date% %time%`): inserted by F5 and the Insert Time/Date command. Use `%date%`/`%time%` to honor `DateFormat`/`TimeFormat`, or use `%shortdate%`, `%longdate%`, `%shorttime%`, `%longtime%` directly.
- `DateFormat` (default `%shortdate%`): format used by `%date%` in templates. Set it to a built‑in variable (like `%shortdate%`) or a custom date format string.
- `TimeFormat` (default `HH:mm`): format used by `%time%` in templates. Set it to a built‑in variable (like `%shorttime%`) or a custom time format string.
- `OutputPaneLines` (default `5`): height of the output pane. Use an integer for a fixed number of lines (for example, `10`) or append `%` for a percentage of the available area (for example, `20%`).
- `OutputPaneReadOnly` (default `0`): `1` makes the output pane read-only; `0` keeps it editable.
- `FilterDebug` (default `0`): `1` enables debug logging for filter and REPL execution. When active, the output pane shows the resolved command, working directory, exit code, and stderr for each filter run. REPL sessions additionally log every input line sent and output chunk received. In REPL mode, typing `\raw:<text>` on a prompt line sends the text with escape expansion and no automatic EOL — useful for testing exact byte sequences. This key is not written to the INI by default; add `FilterDebug=1` manually when needed for troubleshooting.

Date/time variables and custom formats (Windows date/time picture tokens).

- Built‑in variables:
  - `%shortdate%`: system short date (for example, 1/20/2026).
  - `%longdate%`: system long date (for example, Monday, January 20, 2026).
  - `%yearmonth%`: year and month (for example, January 2026).
  - `%monthday%`: month and day (for example, January 20).
  - `%shorttime%`: short time without seconds (for example, 10:30 PM).
  - `%longtime%`: long time with seconds (for example, 10:30:45 PM).
- Date tokens: `d dd ddd dddd M MM MMM MMMM y yy yyyy g gg`.
- Time tokens: `h hh H HH m mm s ss t tt`.
- Example templates: `DateTimeTemplate=%date% 'at' %time%`, `DateTimeTemplate=%longdate% 'at' %shorttime%`.
- Custom date formats (examples): `yyyy-MM-dd`, `dd.MM.yyyy`, `MMMM d, yyyy`.
- Custom time formats (examples): `HH:mm`, `h:mm tt`, `HH:mm:ss`.
- Literals: wrap in single quotes (example: `DateTimeTemplate=%longdate% 'at' %shorttime%`).

RichEdit library selection (advanced).

- `RichEditLibraryPath` (default empty): custom RichEdit DLL path; empty uses auto‑detection.
- `RichEditClassName` (default empty): optional class override (e.g., `RichEditD2DPT`, `RichEdit60W`).
- `AutocorrectionSound` (default empty): WAV file played after each typing autocorrection; relative paths resolve from the `RichEditor.exe` directory. Empty disables sound.
- `SmartPairAssist` (default `1`): `1` enables the skip-over and Backspace-delete helpers for typing autocorrections that use `\c` cursor placement with a single-character closing. Set to `0` to disable both helpers; `\c` cursor placement itself is unaffected.

Internal state (usually not edited by hand).

- `CurrentFilter` (default empty): last selected filter by name.
- `CurrentREPLFilter` (default empty): last selected REPL filter by name.

### [Filters] and [FilterN]

`[Filters]` stores an optional key:

- `Count` (optional): number of filter entries. If omitted, filter sections are probed sequentially (`[Filter1]`, `[Filter2]`, ...) until an empty or missing `Name=` is found.

Each `[FilterN]` defines one filter. Required fields:

- `Name`: display name.
- `Command`: command line to execute.

Common optional fields:

- `Description`: short help text (shown in menus when enabled).
- `Category`: submenu grouping (user‑defined; can be any label).
- `Name.xx` / `Description.xx`: localized strings (for example, `Name.cs`).
- `Action` (default `insert`): behavior type. `insert` = insert output, `display` = show output, `clipboard` = put in clipboard, `none` = side effects only, `repl` = interactive (REPL).

Action‑specific fields:

- `Insert` (default `below`): `replace`, `below`, or `append`.
- `Display` (default `messagebox`): `messagebox`, `statusbar`, or `pane`.
  - `pane` shows output in the output pane below the editor. The pane appears on the first use and stays visible for the session.
  - Optional `Pane` key (comma‑separated): `append` (add to existing content instead of replacing), `focus` (move focus to pane after writing), `start` (place caret at start of newly written output: position 0 for replace mode, start of appended chunk for append mode). Example: `Pane=append,focus`.
- `Clipboard` (default `copy`): `copy` or `append`.
- `PromptEnd` (default `> `): REPL prompt terminator string (for example, `> ` or `$ `).
- `EOLDetection` (default `auto`): end‑of‑line (EOL) detection for REPL output. `auto` detects from the first output; `crlf` = Windows, `lf` = Unix/Linux/WSL, `cr` = classic Mac.
- `ExitNotification` (default `1`): 1 shows a dialog when a REPL filter exits, 0 is silent.

Context menu placement:

- `ContextMenu` (default `0`): show in right‑click menu (1) or only in Tools (0).
- `ContextMenuOrder` (default `999`): sort order; lower numbers appear first.

### [Templates] and [TemplateN]

`[Templates]` stores an optional key:

- `Count` (optional): number of template entries. If omitted, template sections are probed sequentially until an empty or missing `Name=` is found.

Each `[TemplateN]` defines one template:

- `Name`: template name.
- `Description`: short help text.
- `Category`: submenu grouping (user‑defined; can be any label).
- `Name.xx` / `Description.xx`: localized strings (for example, `Name.cs`).
- `FileExtension` (default empty): limit to a file type; empty means all.
- `Template`: template text; supports `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\\`.
- `Shortcut` (default empty): optional hotkey. Use the same format as `Ctrl+1`, `Ctrl+Shift+C`, or `Alt+F2`. Supported key names include letters A–Z, numbers 0–9, F1–F12, and special keys like `Enter`, `Space`, `Tab`, `Backspace`, `Delete`, `Insert`, `Home`, `End`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`, and arrow keys. If a shortcut collides with built‑in commands, it is ignored; if unsure about key names, check the default template examples in `RichEditor.ini`.

### [MRU]

Stores most recently used files. `File1` is the newest entry, followed by `File2`, `File3`, and so on. The list length depends on recent activity.

### [AutocorrectionSettings]

Controls which autocorrection tables are applied automatically. Each key is a table name (matching the `Name=` of an `[AutocorrectionTableN]` section); the value is a comma-separated list of modes:

- `typing` — apply after every keystroke.
- `repl` — apply to incoming REPL output before ANSI colours are stripped.

Example:

```ini
[AutocorrectionSettings]
Emoticons=typing,repl
Abbrev=typing
```

Tables not listed here are available for manual use only via the `Tools → Apply Autocorrections` submenu.

### [FindHistory] / [ReplaceHistory]

Each section stores:

- `Count`: number of history items.
- `Item1`, `Item2`, ...: most recent first.

### [Resume]

Autosave recovery data:

- `ResumeFile`: path to the current recovery file (set at runtime; cleared after a successful load).
- `OriginalPath`: original path (empty for untitled files).

Recovery files are stored in `%TEMP%\RichEditor\` by default, or in the folder set by `AutoSaveTempDir`.

## Screen Reader Support

RichEditor annotates its controls with accessible names using the MSAA Dynamic Annotation API (`IAccPropServices`). NVDA, JAWS, and Windows Narrator announce:

- **"Text Editor"** for the main editing area.
- **"Output Pane"** for the secondary output pane (when present).

Both MSAA and UI Automation clients receive these names as the control's Name property.

## RichEdit Library (Advanced)

RichEditor can load newer RichEdit DLLs for better accessibility and rendering. Windows 11 Notepad ships with a modern RichEdit build that improves plain-text caret/selection behavior (especially near line ends and trailing spaces) and uses DirectWrite and UI Automation for color emoji and screen reader support.

You can point to Office RichEdit DLLs (e.g., Office 2013+), which often include more recent fixes than the Windows system DLL. Use `RichEditLibraryPath` and `RichEditClassName` in the INI if you want to experiment. For Windows Notepad, a typical path looks like: `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsNotepad_11.x.x.x_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\Notepad\riched20.dll`.

## Command Line (Advanced)

```
RichEditor.exe [options] [filename]

/nomru     Open without adding to MRU
/readonly  Open in read-only mode
```

Note: `/elevated-save` is used internally by the editor when retrying a save with administrator permissions. It is not intended for direct use.
